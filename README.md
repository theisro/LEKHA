Lekha aims to make artist archives easier and more accessible. 

The platform is an outcome of work done during the pandemic, in response to the difficulty of using existing archival software. Lekha aims to solve this problem by allowing artists to create, organize and share archives of their works easily.

Lekha is always a work in progress. We are committed to remain open, accessible, free to use, and in service of all artists and creatives around the globe. Please do reach out to us if there is a feature you would like to see implemented on lekha. 

Lekha is a project by the Software Design Research group at The Indian Sonic Research Organisation (theISRO).
