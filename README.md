## Lists, Exhibition and Knowledge Hueristics for the Arts - LEKHA

Lekha aims to make artist archives easier and more accessible. 

The platform is an outcome of work done during the pandemic, in response to the difficulty of using existing archival software. Lekha aims to solve this problem by allowing artists to create, organize, and share archives of their works easily.

Lekha is always a work in progress. We are committed to remain open, accessible, free to use, and in service of all artists and creatives around the globe. Please do reach out to us if there is a feature you would like to see implemented on lekha. 

Lekha is a project by the Software Design Research group at The Indian Sonic Research Organisation (theISRO).

### The Design Process

LEKHA has a unique take on archives. Media files in LEKHA are called “ART”. Art could be documents, sound files, video, texts, STL files or any other file that you might think of. LEKHA does not discriminate. ART is added to the ARCHIVE using a process called ARCHIVING. The act of “ARCHIVING” could include creating, adding, changing or even deleting ARCHIVES. These metaphors with the real world act of archiving also apply to the software design philosophy. For example:


```
Archiving.add(ARCHIVE_NAME, ART.filename)
```

is a human readable object and a method that could be used to add to an archive.

There are 2 entities in LEKHA - Objects and Processes. Objects include Users, Archives, Artists, Institutions. Processes include that of Archiving - adding, deleting,creating, cataloging..etc.
