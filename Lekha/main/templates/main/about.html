  LEKHA aims to make artist archives easier and more accessible. The platform is
  an outcome of work done during the pandemic, in response to the difficulty of
  using existing archival software. LEKHA aims to solve this problem by allowing
  artists to create, organize and share archives of their works easily.
  <br /><br />
  LEKHA is always a work in progress. We are committed to remain open,
  accessible, and in service of all artists and creatives around the globe.
