Hard to get a sense of the legitimacy of the platform since there’s no way to see how many people currently use it/have ever registered. Might help to create an artists/users page listing all registered members, and link to it on the header (beside go to dashboard, go to archive). Or, you could list the same as “stats”, if listing names is problematic. Like, have a counter for registered users, # of public archives currently on LEKHA, # of files uploaded, etc. Best if it’s visible on the homepage too. 

Regarding the dashboard and filing system:
Make things moveable, like in Google Drive or other apps. There should be an easy way (preferably drag and drop) to move files (and multiple file sets) across series, or even categories. There should also be an option to delete a category or series without having to delete the images they contain first. 

Also do enable users to reorder categories so they can choose what to display first, regardless of when the files were uploaded. 

While viewing another artists archive, viewers might appreciate the option to collapse a large category of images to concentrate on another category (and reduce how much they need to scroll down). Could add a +/- button next to each category and series to do that, assuming it’s not too difficult. 

In the exhibitions, it would be best to link to the artist page before the exhibition text begins. Otherwise people might lose interest before giving it a chance. If they like looking at the work, they might be more inclined to go back and read the text fully.
